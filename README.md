# Rural-Low-Voltage-Detection

Research on Rural Low-Voltage Detection and Prediction using LSTM and hybrid models.

## Project Structure
- `Research_Guidelines.md`: Detailed research directions and model application logic.
- `src/`: Source code for models (to be added).
- `data/`: Dataset samples and preprocessing scripts (to be added).
- `docs/`: Paper drafts and technical documents.

## Research Context
This project focuses on solving **long-term dependency** and **non-linear fluctuation** problems in rural power grids using:
- Standard LSTM
- Hybrid CNN-LSTM
- Prediction-based Anomaly Detection
- LSTM + GNN/GIN Spatio-Temporal models
- Multi-variable external feature enhancement
