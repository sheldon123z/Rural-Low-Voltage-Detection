Visual Style: Clean vector-like appearance, sharp edges, professional technical diagram\n2. Color Palette:\n   - Primary: IEEE blue (#0076A8)\n   - Secondary: Dark gray (#333333)\n   - Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)\n   - Accent: Light gray (#E5E5E5)\n3. Design: Minimal shadows, flat design, no decorative elements\n4. Typography style: Sans-serif (but NO actual text on image)\n5. High contrast suitable for print reproduction\n6. IMPORTANT: Generate ONLY visual elements, NO text labels or annotations\n\nLayout: Horizontal flow, 3 distinct sections\n",
