  "prompt": "\nCreate a two-panel FFT visualization (top and bottom).\n\nTOP PANEL: TIME DOMAIN\n- Continuous waveform with visible periodic pattern\n- X-axis represents time\n- Y-axis represents amplitude\n- IEEE blue line\n\nBOTTOM PANEL: FREQUENCY DOMAIN\n- Bar chart / spectrum plot\n- X-axis represents frequency\n- Y-axis represents magnitude\n- 2-3 prominent peaks in IEEE blue (dominant frequencies)\n- Other frequencies in light gray\n- Clear peak-to-background contrast\n\nCONNECTION:\n- Large arrow between panels\n- Arrow points downward (time → frequency)\n\n\nCRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS for IEEE academic publication:\n1. Visual Style: Clean vector-like appearance, sharp edges, professional technical diagram\n2. Color Palette:\n   - Primary: IEEE blue (#0076A8)\n   - Secondary: Dark gray (#333333)\n   - Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)\n   - Accent: Light gray (#E5E5E5)\n3. Design: Minimal shadows, flat design, no decorative elements\n4. Typography style: Sans-serif (but NO actual text on image)\n5. High contrast suitable for print reproduction\n6. IMPORTANT: Generate ONLY visual elements, NO text labels or annotations\n\nLayout: Vertical stack, two panels\n",
  "generated_description": "The two-panel FFT visualization consists of a vertical stack of two panels:  \n**Layout Dimensions**: 600px width × 400px height total, split into two equal 300px vertical panels.  \n**Color Codes**: Primary #0076A8 (blue), Secondary #333333 (dark gray), Background #FFFFFF (white), Accent #E5E5E5 (light gray).  \n**Shapes**: Rounded corners with 0.5mm radius; line thickness 1pt.  \n**Positioning**: Top panel displays a time-domain waveform with smooth periodic peaks; bottom panel features a frequency spectrum bar chart with three dominant peaks (peaks at 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 Hz). Arrows connect panels with a downward-pointing large (10pt) arrow.  \n**Connection Arrow**: A solid dark blue (primary) arrow points downward from top to bottom, 150px width, 30° angle.  \n**Recreation Guide**: In draw.io: Import two panels, assign colors, align elements vertically, set axis labels implicitly (no text), position bars centrally, draw lines between panels, set arrow style to solid, 30° angle. Ensure no decorative elements, maintain contrast. All elements must align precisely to 1:1 ratio, with zero spacing.",
